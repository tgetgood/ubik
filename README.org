#+TITLE: lemonade

Experiment in higher order visual programming.

* Overview
	This is both a library for doing vector graphics in a data driven idiomatic
	clojure fashion and a framework for making interactive graphics / animations /
	UIs using that library.

	These two parts will likely be separated at a future date, but since the is
	mostly an experiment at present, it's far more convenient to keep them
	together.
* Breakdown
	The core graphics primitives are in =lemonade.core=.

	Renderers are in =lemonade.renderers.*=. There are currently only 2, an HTML
	Canvas 2d rendering context renderer for the browser and a quil renderer for
	JVM Clojure.

	Demo setups of the two renderers are in =lemonade.demos.*=, and examples that
	*should* work in either are in =lemonade.examples.*=

* Getting Started
** Install
	 To get an interactive development environment run:

	 lein figwheel

	 and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).  This will
	 auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the need to
	 reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will get a Browser
	 Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

	 (js/alert "Am I connected?")

	 and you should see an alert in the browser window.

	 To clean all compiled files:

	 lein clean

	 To create a production build run:

	 lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

	 And open your browser in =resources/public/index.html=. You will not get live
	 reloading, nor a REPL.

** Play
	 There isn't any good way to switch between examples just yet. Look at
	 whatever function defines =lemonade.demos.canvas/base= and play with it, the
	 changes should update automatically.

* Development
** Demo
	 I think the best demo would show what the system can do, explain how it's
	 different that makes it possible, and shows interactively how it works.

	 I have this vague notion of multilevel documents that have content,
	 metacontent, etc. where you can go from tldr to intensely detailed through a
	 series of "show me more" type requests.

	 The problem is that I have too many ideas and they all reach in different
	 directions.

	 What am I building?
** Actions Needed
*** DONE Text
		 CLOSED: [2017-11-28 Tue 11:58]
*** DONE Finish Elections Demo
		 CLOSED: [2017-11-28 Tue 11:57]
		This has lots of little bits that are needed for polish
*** TODO Pacman
		Not the full game, just enough to force test lazy animations and
		interactivity.
*** TODO Second Implementation
		The Quil based JVM renderer is just a stub really. I need a second
		implementation to call me out anywhere I might be thinking in terms of
		canvas.
*** TODO Animations in event loop
		If the app state doesn't change then render won't be called. So interactive
		animations need to return a lazy seq of frames which will be poped off by
		the event loop event if the app state hasn't changed. Of course whatever
		makes this lazy-seq will need to be aware of game time.

		I don't know how to do this. Yet another experiment.
*** TODO Lazy rendering
*** TODO Direct bitmaps
		Some operations are too expensive for a vector representation. Some things
		(like the Mandlebrot set) are defined pixelwise, and I don't know that
		trying to redefine them would be productive.

		So, play around and try to find idioms that are productive and fit.

*** TODO Physics
*** TODO Text boxes
		Given a long string and a bounding shape, we should be able to do things
		like wrapping and justifying.
*** TODO Demo animation / game
		The line between the two can be very blurry if we think of physics as
		strictly Newtonian. Without input from the user, the "game" is an animation
		since the physics are all deterministic.

		This might be a terrible way to make games, but it might also work. Fun test.

*** TODO Render caching
		The renderer is reasonably fast, but will choke on complicated things.
*** TODO Draw a map from GIS data
		Elections Canada released an enourmous KML file containing the boundaries of
		every polling station of every riding in the country. That could make a very
		detailed map. Can I render that on the fly? Think of it as a stress test.
*** TODO Proceedural Drawing
		This is a big one, but too hard to insist that it be required.

		I'd like to come up with a way to create a declarative spec of a proceedural
		drawing that the runtime can compile with perlin noise into a lemonade
		shape.

		That can be done offline and the shapes can be hotloaded in the client if
		need be.

		How does one declaratively specify a proceedural drawing?!?

** Lessons from Expanse
	 Trying to build expanse has brought up a number of interesting points:
*** Windowing
		Having multiple independent windows in a page didn't seem like a valid use
		case. Now it does. Beyond that, the need for multiple windows is bringing to
		light the inadequacy of the event system.

		Keeping separate windows under separate keys doesn't work unless the event
		system knows which substree is being clicked on. As it is, the same events
		are fired no matter where on the screen the user scrolls. This means that
		everything zooms in sync and it's as if there were only one window
		again. That's no good.

		Remember that the ideal is trivial composability. Take anything and embed it
		anywhere.
** Errors and Messages
	 Currently they're useless. The two errors that come up 90% of the time are
	 "can't render nil" and "can't render function([native code])". The latter
	 means that you passed in a function as a value — which should trigger a
	 special error because it's getting me over and over and would be useful —
	 while the former could mean anything. It generally means something in the
	 pipeline failed and by nil punning we get a nil at the very end. Even more
	 useless.

	 We should be able to trace the path through the render tree so that (in
	 combination with named shapes) we can give useful traces of errors. Possibly
	 even source mapped errors once the code is being compiled on the fly. Let's
	 not get too far ahead of ourselves.
* Notable Flaws
** Zoom Misbehaviour
	 Zoom only works in the range of about [-9000 9000]. That's ~[1e-40 1e38].

	 I don't know why that is. It's nowhere near the precision limit of floats,
	 let alone doubles. What's most fascinating is that when you multiply the zoom
	 matrix by the scale matrix at the limit you get values on the order of 0.3!
	 perfectly precise for our application.

	 Maybe this is a limit in the significant part, not the exponential part. That
	 would align roughly with the failure conditions.

	 So I need to look for some mathematical trick to not recover small numbers by
	 multiplying really big ones and really small ones. That sounds hard. I also
	 don't know that it will solve my problem. Better diagnosis tools would be in
	 order.

	 A zoom scale of ~100 doublings isn't that bad. For the time being I can make
	 progress by just bounding the zoom.
** Windowing [2017-12-02 Sat 12:15]
	 At present we can render effectively infinite drawings by having the base
	 image handler refer to the window data and decide what to show based on the
	 current window position.

	 This works, but it needlessly couples the window handling with the
	 image. Furthermore, it means that we can't use the image in a static
	 windowless context without stubbing out a window. Of course that's kind of
	 obvious that you need to choose a window to determine what you see, but at
	 the same time the coupling in code between the so called framework piece and
	 the business logic is ugly.

	 In principle we should be able to compute the extent of a vo and decide in
	 the runtime whether to render it or not. This is the kind of global
	 optimisation that can pay huge returns potentially, but how can we do it?

	 The only way that I can figure is to make a new kind of composite which knows
	 its extent. Its children can in turn be of the same sort. In this way an
	 image with infinite content can be represented by a lazy tree and rendering
	 will get cut off at the point where an element and all its children are
	 invisible.

	 This doesn't solve the problem of images that are infinite in extent, like
	 grid lines, or images that are unreasonably large in extent like a highly
	 zoomed in mandlebrot set.

	 Maybe the concept of window needs to be fundamental to the framework. You may
	 not need the dynamic window interaction, but you do need to specify the
	 mapping from real space into coordinate space. Everything depends on that, so
	 that dependency should be explicit.

	 Things are getting less and less declarative as we go. This is going to make
	 my life more difficult. Especially in regards to automatic code
	 simplification.
* Ultimate Direction
	What is this library supposed to be? What is it supposed to become? To be
	honest I don't know. I should include more of the history of thought behind it
	as a partial answer, but that requires editing thousands of lines of planning
	docs, so not happening anytime soon.

	Here are some things that I want. Not comprehensive.

** A New Way to Program for the End User
	 That's what this is becoming. A new internet platform — with the JVM
	 version we're not actually dependent on the web, it's just a convenience
	 delivery mechanism — intended for creating content that can be inspected
	 and taken apart in place by anyone. The editor I'm thinking of is really
	 more a form of dev tooling running in the runtime environment of the apps
	 themselves.

	 Metacircular, very lispy, possibly slow, but potentially more powerful than
	 anything since smalltalk.
** Ecosystem
	 We need something like https://bl.ocks.org/. A simple repository to browse
	 demos with code.

	 It should be trivial for anyone to create a little demo and put it
	 up. We'll need to be able to lazily fetch the code samples, because there
	 are going to be a lot of them (hopefully). This page has to be written in
	 the system itself. We're not just making a D3 clone.

	 The interesting part of this would be if I can get code tracing
	 working. That means that when you select some group of visual objects on
	 the screen, the underlying system can pull the code that generates that set
	 out of the code for the whole. This way you don't actually need to include
	 code examples with examples. The code is there running the examples after
	 all.

	 Code comments are a problem. One which I don't think I can solve since
	 comments have implicit semantic ties to static aspects of the code and I
	 don't want to treat code as a static thing. Quite the opposite.

	 I think we can find a different kind of commentary to replace code
	 comments. Something that ties directly into the UI.
** Editor
	 [[aprt.us][Apparatus]] has huge potential for creating very complex interactions.
	 This is the kind of editor I want to make, but I think the potential for
	 tooling using lemonade — Just building on figwheel and maybe adding
	 something like Elm's time travelling debugger — is huge.
** Remixable UIs
	 The ultimate goal is to have an editor that can open another page, grab a
	 piece of its content and drop it into whatever you're creating. Anything
	 you can see has been rendered to a data structure, so the graphics should
	 be trivial to get. The trees can be rearranged quite easily.

	 The trouble arises when you want to grab something with foreign event
	 handlers, or if the vo being copied is generated by complex logic from a
	 state object. You need to grab the relevant bits of state, and the relevant
	 code paths that generate what you're looking at from it. That sounds
	 hard. Handlers aren't so bad since we can give them fully qualified names
	 and look them up in a registry.

	 I don't know how we're going to get the code paths. I can imagine a tracing
	 renderer that annotates objects as they are created with the code that
	 created them. Then going back through sequence operations becomes possible
	 (select some subrange of what was mapped over and preserve the mapping
	 function). I don't know what to do about more complex code though. This is
	 a compiler problem and I don't know how to write compilers.

	 Copying an entire thing into your code is pretty trivial though since you
	 can just replace your base renderer with =(juxt old-thing new-thing)= and get
	 a new renderer. The event handling and transformation chains shouldn't be a
	 problem. It won't be too hard to enforce idempotency as long as the same
	 event/tx layers are used. But what happens when event and tx layers don't
	 play nice with each other?

	 There's still a lot of work to be done figuring out what happens when you
	 decompose and rearrange these affine hierarchies...
** Multi User Experiences
	 What does it mean for a web app to be multi user? That's a fun topic to
	 explore.

	 More immediately I'm interested in collaborative creation of demos. Shared
	 demo space, different editing spaces, editing spaces should be publicly
	 readable so that you can watch someone work. But shared editing is more
	 difficult.

	 This is mostly a thought experiment at present. What would happen if you
	 wrote emacs today with an etherpad style crdt document model?

** Breaking the Curse of Lisp?
	 Part of the origin story of Lemonade was an AI experiment in learning
	 analysis and synthesis. If you write code that draws something that looks
	 virtually the same as something someone else has done (and published), then
	 the tooling should be able to tell you so.

	 In the small, you should be able to hand draw quickly with a stylus and have
	 the program pick up on what you're trying to draw. There's a continuum
	 between exactly what you drew and some simplified platonic ideal. The ideal
	 drawing tool would give you a slider to control this tradeoff. It likely has
	 multiple dimensions, but that's a UI problem.

	 I think these two problems are essentially the same thing: to recognise when
	 a given piece of code is a (partial or almost) special case of some known
	 code, to flag such this fact to the user, and to offer up a ready to go
	 integration that uses the existing library instead of rewriting your partial
	 solution.

	 See how this might break the curse of lisp? If the tool automatically tells
	 you how to use some other library to do what you want and you extend it, and
	 then someone else is told they can use your extention, ... you no longer have
	 a single library, but you do have a body of code that satisfies the use cases
	 of everyone who's used it and keeps growing.

	 Curation and style are unsolved problems here. It's quite possible the
	 software could make subpar suggestions and get the ecosystem as a whole into
	 a rut. Some sort of community curation side channel to the code simplifier is
	 essential, but I haven't thought enough to have anything close to a solution
	 to this.
